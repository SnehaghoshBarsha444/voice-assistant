A Python-based voice assistant that can recognize voice commands and perform various tasks.

## Features
- Speech recognition
- Voice output

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.7+). You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/SnehaghoshBarsha444/voice-assistant.git
cd voice-assistant
```

### Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To start the voice assistant, run:
```sh
python main.py
```

## Customization
You can modify the `main.py` file to add or change commands as per your requirements.

## Dependencies
The project uses the following Python libraries:
- `speechrecognition` – For recognizing speech
- `pyttsx3` – For text-to-speech conversion
- `pyaudio` – For capturing voice input

Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the project.

## Troubleshooting
- If `pyaudio` fails to install, use the following command:
  ```sh
  pip install pyaudio
  ```
  If the error persists, install it manually from [this link](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio).

- If `speechrecognition` fails to work properly, check your microphone settings and permissions.
